# Social-Network-API

## Description

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.

In this project, I built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list.

Packages used includes Express.js for routing, and Mongoose packages.
